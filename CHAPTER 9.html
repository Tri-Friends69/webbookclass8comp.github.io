<ul type="square">
      <li>We must always remember that all other internet users are strangers. We usually do not know whom we are chatting with. So we should be extremely careful and polite and must follow netiquettes.</li>
      <li>We should avoid getting into arguments during chat or discussions with other users.</li>
      <li>Most of the teenagers compate los a huge friends list online: We should be careful before confirming friend's request. Confirming a complete stranger as a friend can be dangerous. As we do not talk to stranger on road similarity we should not add total strangers to our friend lists.</li>

      <li>We should not always keep our computers online. Either we must shut them off when not in use or physically disconnect them from Internet connection.</li>
      <li>Never open e-mail attachments from strangers, regardless of how interesting the subject line or attachment may be.</li>
