		<h2><center>LOOPING</center></h2>
		<p>
			LOOPING is represented execution of certain steps (statements forming Body of Loop) for a fixed number of times". This controlled repetition can be achieved by following steps:
			<ol>
				<li>Initailization of Control Variable</li>
				<li> Statements to be repeated forming BODY of Loop</li>
				<li> Incrementing the value of Control Variable (COUNT = COUNT + 1)  </li>
				<li>Checking Control variable against FINAl (COUNT < FINAL) 
                    	<ul>
                    		<li>If Condition is TRUE control goes back to the BODY of LOOP</li>
							<li>Tf Condition is FALSE Control moves to next step (Statement 5)</li>

                    	</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Display "LOOP OVER"</li>
				<li>END</li>

			</ol>  
		</p>

	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>FOR-NEXT STATEMENT</h2>
		<p>The process of looping can be simplified with the help of OFR-NEXT statement.This Single statement has all the three steps required for making a loop,i.e
			<ol>
				<li>Initailised of control Variable </li>
				<li> Condition Checking with Final value</li>
				<li> Incrementing/decrementing Control Variable</li>

			</ol>
			FOR-NEXt is best suited when some statements are to be <b>repeated fixed number of times.</b>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>How FOR-NEXT works?</h2>
		<ul>
				<li>When <b>control comes to FOR statement first time,the Initail Value is assigned to control variable.</b></li>
				<li>Statements given <b>between</b>For and NEXT are executed.</li>
				<li>NEXT statement increments the value of CONTrol Variable by 1 and shifts the control to FOR statement (Beginning of LOOP)</li>
				<li>value of Control VAriavble is Checked <b>against Final Value</b>, if it is still less than or equal to Final value the statements in Body of Loop are represented. </li>
				<li>If value of Control Variable exceeds thr Final Value, the control shilfts out of the  loop and statement given after NEXT is executed</li>
			
		</ul>

		 	<h2>CREATING THE FUTURE PROJECTS</h2>
		 	What is Project?<br>
		 	Any work which has a specified aim and has to be completed in defined period of time can be carried over like a project.
		 	<table>
		 		<tr>
		 			<td>A project is any systematic activity which has to be completed in a given time frame.  </td>
		 		</tr>
		 	</table> 
		 	<ul>
		 		Every project has certain characteristics:-
				<li>Every projects has a <b>defined objectives/ goal/ aim.</b> </li>
				<li>It consists of <b>sequence of tasks and subtasks.</b></li>
				<li>Every <b>task has a specific purpose</b> and is clearly defined.</li>
				<li>The project has a <b>defined timeline according to which its tasks should be completed.</b></li>
				<li>Every project has its <b>time limit.</b></li>
		 		
		 	</ul>

			<h2>PROJECT MANAGEMENT CYCLE</h2>
			A project will be successfully completed if we follow the steps of <b>project management cycle.</b><br>
			<b>A Project Management Cycle consists of following steps:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Identification and Planning:</b>
					The main aim of the project is <b>identified and planning is done to achieve the aim in a defined time period.</b></li>
				<li><b>Coordination and Organization: Proper coordination of all the activities is done to complete each task in time . Finally, the tasks are compiled to get the final project</b></li>
				<li><b>Implementation:</b>
				the project is executed after compiling all the activities.</li>
				<li><b>Monitoring </b>
				the tasks are supervised thoroughly so that the activities are running properly.</li>
				<li><b>Evalution and Testing</b>
				All the tasks are evaluted and tested properly before finally executing the project. </li>
				
			</ul>

					<h2> A WORD OF CAUTION</h2>
					When we work on computer then certain malicious programs/software get automatically downloaded into our computer through pen drives or internet.These programs may corrupt data,multiply data unnecessarily or lead to malfunctioning of other software.

					<table border="3">
						<tr>
							<th>Worms</th>
							<th>Virus</th>

						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>a compyer program that replicates itself and cause problems with smooth functioning of compter. However,unlike it does not require a host program or human help to propogate itself .</td>
							<td> A compter virus is malicious program that disturbs the normal functioning
							of compter . It replicates by copying itself to anohter program.</td>

				<p>
					We should be aware of two more terms in order to have good understanding for working on a computer. These terms are:-
					<ol>
						<li>Format or Formatting the computer memeory.</li>
						<li> Defragmentation of computer memory</li>

					</ol>
					Sometimes, computer gets corrupted to such an extent that we need to Format the computer.

					<br>

					<b>Formatting is the process to prepare hard disk of a computer to store data.One should be very careful while formatting as formatting a disk or computer erases all the existing data on it.</b>
				</p>
			</div> 
			<div>
				<p>
					What is fragmentation?<br>
					Whenever we store a file on a computer it takes some space in the memeory(hard disk). We mat store more than one files in a computer. These files are stored one after another in the computer's memory. After some time if we don't require a file, we may delete it . This leaves a blank chunk of memory. These chunks are called Fragments.
				</p>
				<p>
					Defragmentation is the process of reorganizing the computer memory to arrange all the files in countinuity and combine all the blank chunks together to form a large blank space in memory.
