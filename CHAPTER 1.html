<h2>Need of Communication</h2>
<p>Communication is important to express oneself.Communication means to be able to convey thoughts and ideas,and everything that needs to be conveyed or expressed.It is certainly true taht not only humans but also many or all animals communicate.


<p>Modes of communication keeps on having diverse changes with flow of time. History of communication started with carrier pigeons, horsemen and then letters and telegrams being used for sending messages. Gradually, with changing times, telephones came into existence.They were very easy to use and also connected as far of distant locations within no time. Since telephones were static so mobile phones were invented and came into existence .</p>

<p>Computers have not only simplified but also made the complex mathematical or scientific calculations possible.<br><mark><b>As we all know,each computer has its own keyboard,mouse,scanner and printer also called Peripheral Devices.</b></mark></p>

<p>If two or more people wish to share the data or infirmation,they have to move around with CD's,DVD's,etc.However,the need of sending and receiving more and more information among individuals/ organizations on the click of a mouse has given<b><u> birth to the computer networks.</b></u><p>
<h4>A computer network is a collection of two or more computers connected together in order to communicate and share that data and information.</h4><center>
<img src="ASSETS/images/pic02.jpg" height="100px" width="200px" ></center>
<p><b><mark>Usually the connections between computers in a network are made using physical wires or cables. However, some connections are wireless using radio waves or infrared waves.</b></mark></p>

<p>When we connect two or more computers together  we get a network.<u>On this network, a central computer <mark>(server)</mark>,acts as the storage location for files and applications that are shared on network. Servers store and send data to other computers and also control the network access of other computers which are referred to as the<mark> 'client'</mark> computers.Client are computers that receive and send data from servers.</u></p><hr>

<p><i><b>Devices required for establishing computer network-</b> <br>
<ul type="square">
<li>Cables</li>
<li>NIC(Network Interface Card)</li>
<li>Switch</li>
<li>Modem</li>
<li>Router</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><b><u><i>Cables</b></u></i>-A cable is a thick wire, or a group of wires inside a rubber or plastic covering, which is used to carry electricity or electronic signals.They connect the computers or other peripheral devices to each other.</li><hr>
<li><b><u><i>NIC-(Network Interface Card)</b></u></i>-A Network Interface Card or NIC is the network interface device which connects the computer to the special device,called switch,which in turn links all the computers on the network together.</li><hr>
<li><b><u><i>Switch</b></u></i>-A switch is used to connect multiple devices(such as computers,printers, scanners,etc.) which need to be connected to each other in a network.A switch can thus connect computers, printers and serve,creating a network of shared resources. </li><hr>
<li><b><u><i>Modem</b></u></i>-A Modem is a hardware device which means Modulator-Demodulator. Modems are used for data transfer from one computer network to another computer network through telephone lines. The computer network works in digital mode, while analog technology is used for carrying messages across phone lines.The Modulator converts information from digital mode to analog mode at the transmitting end and demodulator converts the same from analog to digital at the receiving end.</li><hr>
<li><b><u><i>Router</b></u></i>-Another device most commonly used in networking is a Router which is used to tie or join multiple networks together. The Router will act as a courier choosing the best route for your information to travel so that you receive it quickly.</li><hr><hr length="50%">

<h1><b><u>Wired Network Technology</b></u></h1>

<p>A wired network is a network which uses networking cables to connect devices (computers,printers, scanners, etc.).<br><br>

Similarly,the term wireless network refers to two or more computers communicating using standard network rules but without the use of cables to connect the computers together. Instead,the computers use wireless radio signals,microwave signals,satellites to send information from one device to the other.</p>

<h1><b><u>Types Of Network</u></b></h1>


<p>Wired or wireless networks can be classified or divided into various types depending upon the area covered by the network or size of the network. A network can be established in a small room or a building or it can be as big as covering the whole city or town.<br>Depending upon the geographical area covered by a network, it is classified as:</p>

<div style="background-color:IndianRed ">

<h3><u>Local area networks(LANs):</u></h3>
<p><ul type="square">
<li>Local Area Network (LAN) is a computer network covering a small area like a home, office, or a group of buildings, such as a school or a college.</li>
<li>A simple LAN can consist of a Personal Computer and a printer or it can connect several computers</li>
<li>it is usually fast, with speed from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps.</li>
<li>All the connected devices share information (text,graphics, video, audio etc.) with each other.</li>
<li>It requires little wiring, typically a single cable connected to each device.</li>
<li>its set-up involves lower cost as compared to MAN'S or WAN's.</li>
<li>LAN's can be either wired or wireless.</li></ul></p><hr></div>

<h3><u>Metropolitan area networks(MANs):</u></h3>

<p><ul type="square">
<li>A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network covering a large area like a campus, corporate offices or a city.</li>
<li>It is also used as the interconnection of several local area networks.</li>
<li>A MAN is often a high speed network and allows sharing of multiple resources.</li>
<li>Examples of MAN: Telephone company network that providesa high speed DSL to customers and cable TV network,Branches of a Nationalised bank in several cities connected together.</li></ul></p><hr>


<h3><u>Wide area networks(WANs):</u></h3>

<p><ul type="square">
<li>A Wide Area Network connects LAN and MAN together.</li>
<li>It covers a large geographical area.</li>
<li>This network may be located throughout a country or a continent or even around the world.</li>
<li>WANS may transmit data over high-speed phone lines or wireless links such as satellites</li>
<li>Internet and ATM facility are the examples of WANS.</li></ul></p><hr><hr>



<h2><b><u><mark>Internet</u></b></mark></h2>

<p><b>Internet is a global network connecting millions of computers.</b><br>
Internet is often referred to as a Network of Networks or the World Wide Web (WWW).We can send text messages, Images, videos and audios to our friends living in any part of the world using WhatsApp or electronic mail. We can also search for any information on the internet and email file attachments. Internet enables even dissimilar computers with different operating systems to communicate with each other using a standard set of protocols (rules) called as networking protocols.</p><hr><hr>
